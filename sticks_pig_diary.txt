	It is a time of great uncertainty in wherever the hell I live. 
My neighbor recently lost their house in an act of domestic terrorism 
and had no insurance to cover the loss. How Chase approved their 
mortgage without Homeowners Insurance is beyond me, but I digress. 

	While there is fear in my heart that I too will be a victim, I 
take solace in the fact that my home was built from structurally 
superior sticks. The loss of my neighbor's straw house was an accident 
waiting to happen.

	If something does happen to my home and by some miracle, I
survive, one of my other neighbors has graciously offered me space
inside his brick home. This may only offer a limited reprieve, but I'll
take it under the circumstances.


PIG 2

There once whas a pig who was the youngest of three that had sleep depervation because he was sad, sad the only home
he'd ever knew was taken from him in a breath of glory. He started a group with other pigs and with the strength of
commrodery, then all learned to belive in themselves ALOT. The pigs tried to take down society.


The littlest pig was over burdened with his new found philospohy. In fact he was no longer sure he was the littlest pig.
He no longer know who he was anymore, so much that he took to the streets to fright rich people with makeup on all in an
atempt to prove a point. He had to plan, he didn't one. He's in jail now.
Later I heard my brothers did not do well against the big bad wolf. That made me sad.
